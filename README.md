# Hi there!

This is my personal GitHub that I mainly use to host various projects I'm working on. Mostly just hobby stuff so I don't document most of it (and I started using private repos for a lot of them!)

Here's what you'll likely find:
* Node.js bots and electron apps
* Miscellaneous Python scripts
* Maybe some Unity games

---

Most of my web projects are hosted over at https://yernemm.xyz/ (I haven't updated that site in a couple years... it's on my to-do list.)

My games are usually available on https://yernemm.itch.io/ 

--- 

I haven't been maintaining a lot of my older stuff unfortunately.

Current projects I'm interested in working on:
* Future game jams maybe?
* [VRC Photo Manager](https://github.com/Yernemm/VRC-Photo-Manager)
* Trying to figure out Baldur's Gate 3 modding
