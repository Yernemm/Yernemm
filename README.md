# Hi there!

This is my personal GitHub that I mainly use to host various projects I'm working on. Mostly just hobby stuff so not everything is documented :^)

Here's what you'll likely find:
* Node.js bots and electron apps
* Miscellaneous Python scripts
* Maybe some Unity games

(Work in Progress) My website: https://yernemm.xyz/
